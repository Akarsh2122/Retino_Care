# Retino_Care

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye complication caused by hyperglycemia, also known as diabetes. It can cause vision loss and, in extreme cases, total blindness. Blurred vision, dark areas of vision, cloudy eyes, and difficulty recognizing colors are early symptoms of diabetic retinopathy. The early detection of diabetic retinopathy is critical in preventing total blindness. Around one-third of the world's estimated 285 million diabetics have diabetic retinopathy. The global prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is expected to rise from 126.6 million in 2010 to 191 million by 2030. Non- proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is a form of early retinal disease characterized by small red spots. The appearance of various types of lesions on retinal images indicates the presence of DR. These are microaneurysms (MA), hemorrhages (HM), and soft and hard exudates. Early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy are crucial to prevent vision loss. Regular eye exams and good blood sugar control are key in preventing or managing this condition.
